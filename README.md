# Keylogger
A Python-based tool designed for educational, testing, and nput analysis purposes.   This program demonstrates how keystroke logging **works at a conceptual level** by simulating key events, recording them, and displaying the results.   It does not capture real keystrokes from the system, ensuring safe and ethical use.
