# 🖥️ Key Input Logger (Educational Simulator)

A Python-based tool designed for **educational**, **testing**, and **input analysis** purposes.  
This program demonstrates how keystroke logging **works at a conceptual level** by simulating key events, recording them, and displaying the results.  
It does **not** capture real keystrokes from the system, ensuring safe and ethical use.

---

## ⭐ Description

This tool allows users to:
- Simulate keypress events  
- Record simulated keystrokes to a log file  
- View logs inside the terminal  
- Understand logging workflows without interacting with real user input  

The program is structured for learning purposes, modularity, and safe experimentation.

## 🔧 Key Features

- **Simulated Keystroke Logging**  
  Logs predefined keys for educational demonstration.

- **Timestamped Entries**  
  Each keypress is recorded with a date/time marker.

- **Log Viewer**  
  View previously recorded log data directly in the terminal.

- **Safe & Ethical Design**  
  Does *not* capture real keystrokes from the user or system.

---

## 🎯 Intended Use

This tool is intended for:

- **Learning how logging mechanisms work**  
- **Understanding input processing workflows**  
- **Testing systems that require mock keystroke input**  
- **Safe experimentation with log file creation**

## ⚠️ Legal & Ethical Disclaimer

This program is strictly for **educational** and **legal** use.  
It does *not* record or monitor real keyboard input.

Do **not** modify this tool for malicious purposes.
Unauthorized keylogging is illegal and unethical.
